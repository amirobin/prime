'''
Program to calculate distance between to different geographic locations
the program takes in two command line arguments i.e point of origin and destination
it the returns the distance between the two points
The point of origin is optional(in a case where its not given, the program assumes thats your physical location 
    is your point of origin and uses your ip address to find the point of origin)
usage: gmaps.py -d [destination] -o [origin]
destination = end location
origin[optionl] = prefered starting point its optional and can be ommitted
